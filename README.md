# snake-game
The Snake Game is a classic video game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without the snake colliding with the walls or its own body.
Player Input:
The player controls the snake’s movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
Game Mechanics:
The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the last input.
If the snake eats a food item, it grows in size.
The snake’s body segments follow the head in a specific sequence.
Collision Detection:
The game checks for collisions with the boundaries of the grid or with the snake's own body.
If a collision occurs, the game ends.
Game Over:
If the snake collides with itself or the wall, the game ends, and the player’s score (based on how much food they ate) is displayed.
Restart:
After the game ends, the player can restart the game and try to achieve a higher score.
